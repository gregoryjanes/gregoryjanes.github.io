                    Greg is an avid mechanical keyboard enthusiast and a passionate engineer, his two worlds combine
                    in the 2049 creating a engineered mechanical keyboard masterpiece. He wanted to maintain a traditional look on the 2049, with the first 
                    designs not including the touch screen display. The modern features added to this board were included
                    with the intention to not disrupt the feel and astesteic of a classic wkl for the mechanical keyboard veterans 
                    of the community, while also adding some new and interesting features to help spark a passion amonst new memebers of the hobby.
                    The 2049 was designed with the intention of bringing a new and exciting custom machanical keyboard to your desk and we hope
                    that you see those intention brought to life when you type on it.
